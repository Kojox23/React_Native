I choose to continue the app we did in the challenges.

I developed the following features: 
- A login screen with email and password.
- A login button
  - A screen with differents ships get by a call api and buttons to buy the ship you want to.
- A touchable link read the terms and conditions.
  - A screen with the terms and conditions of the app and a gif.
- A button with an icon to back on the main screen.
- An error message when you are offline.
